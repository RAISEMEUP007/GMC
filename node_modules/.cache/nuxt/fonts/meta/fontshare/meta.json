It is grid-based design – and a very decorative one at that. All of its letterforms are set on an extreme angle. The ‘tops’ and ‘bottoms’ of each stroke reflect that angle, giving the typeface a ‘rotalic’ feeling, as if each letterform was rotated clockwise. Designed by Hitesh Malaviya, Kilhim is his interpretations of the late artist Nasreen Mohamedi’s drawings and photographs. Through the interplay of light and shadows, her work explored the creation and consumption of form. It featured highly structured grids, just like this typeface. Her work achieved a unique level of abstraction, in which simple marks caused grids to form and deform. In her photography, she concentrated on sparseness and shapes. Physical space occupied by the body was a point of departure for her. Beyond the body, there was the urban fabric of the city: the spaces created by walls, windows and intervals in architectural structures, through which people pass. Her almost mathematical placement of lines indicated a sophisticated handling of formal/aesthetic relations on the picture plane, and she carefully weighed the intervals between lines, releasing them onto the page with a rhythmic flow that alluded to musical notation. A lot of intriguing glyph repositioning happens with text set in Kihim, once OpenType features like ‘Contextual Alternates’ are activated. The font also has oldstyle figures as an optional OpenType feature, which is really quite an opulent extra for such an ornamental display typeface. With Kihim’s abstract letterforms and its use of diagonal lines, Malaviya pays homage to the rhythmic quality of Mohamedi’s oeuvre. Often, text in Kihim seems illegible or unrecognisable at first, before the reader starts to see through the rhythmic pattern of thick and thin lines: then one starts to se the written word. The Kihim typeface is named after the place where Mohamedi passed away in 1990, when she was only 53. \n","styles":[{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/KOGNLTCKMHYTVPJIEQEW4B7BPUKAQGXM/XLAHRPYFN6ZW2PAIAUG3R33QFYFJN5QB/4TN7YRXJ3XQYLUTKR4IXYSO62CQLPOJO","id":"b7fd9c34-6a2e-472c-b4e4-dde4e7185aeb","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":800,"body_height":null,"cap_height":748,"descending_leading":-248,"max_char_width":1395,"x_height":500,"y_max":990,"y_min":-354},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":1667,"views_recent":208},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":500,"range_left":300,"range_right":700}],"category":"Serif","designers":[{"bio":"Inga Plönnigs's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Inga Plönnigs"}],"name":"Inga Plönnigs"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"lnum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"onum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"calt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Books"},{"name":"Text"},{"name":"Reading"},{"name":"Editorial"}],"id":"7cc0dccb-747e-4150-a9fd-11e1c75f6c1a","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:45:06Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":false,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Rowan","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

It can be used in both normal text sizes, and really small sizes, too. This is due to its particularly chunky serifs and stroke-endings. The family features five different weights, ranging from Light through Bold. Even in the Light weight, Rowan’s unique serif and stroke-ending-structure give the text a degree of visible stroke contrast. Each weight has an upright and an italic font on offer. The default numerals in each font are oldstyle figures; however, lining figures are also available via an OpenType feature. Via a Stylistic Set, users can access a set of glyphs where the ascending lowercase letters (‘b’, ‘d’, ‘h’, ‘k’, and ‘l’) have no top-serifs; however, even without those serifs, the letters maintain their correct color, thanks to the swelling flairs at the tops of their stems. Each Rowan font also includes a full range of raised punctuation marks for all-caps typesetting. Rowan is an excellent selection for both book designers and editorial designers. It could also shine when used for the display of embedded text in iOS apps. Rowan was developed by the Berlin-based type designer Inga Plönnigs, a graduate of the Type & Media program at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Hague.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/V3A3UUWTL4HXD3T7OTIZSZG57LEZ54HN/IUR4DXNC2C3VSTLYZAZTL4BJYZJOWHSQ/LQ3WIRSTWTSLOR3GNYGRDOS4QMNO4K7R","id":"fa1e00f6-d282-41ba-beb6-792c207dc3bd","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1000,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-240,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":488,"y_max":1000,"y_min":-290},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/DY53QVO26N2HAZN2DCHHLK4E6ZSJ5JYN/5XIFL5FUKMR7Y4U4RBIDZ3MSXHUI2HTN/OGM6QP4ZZ33BLWNFBGDKAL6GFZCEFLF5","id":"c018add0-d9a0-46b7-a092-608f752af173","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1000,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-240,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":1000,"y_min":-290},"weight":{"label":"Light

Comico’s character set is quite large, and it includes almost 1,000 special glyphs – these are ligatures and alternate versions of letters. Comico’s significant variety of extras will be automatically substituted into any text where the OpenType ‘contextual alternates’ feature has been applied. Indeed, the use of this feature is especially recommended for Comico (it is is for all glyph-rich fonts like it), since having multiple versions of each letter in a text make it more likely to appear handwritten. Most of the counterforms in Comico’s letters are large, and all of the letters’ minute details is drawn with straight lines. While the font is intended for use at natural handwriting sizes, if it is used very big, text set with Comico will actually appear pixelated.

The font is designed by Théo Guillard. Stylistically, you could call it a post-modern interpretation of the Garalde genre. Gambarino is different enough from most serif typefaces designed for text that you could combine it with another Garalde easily; that other font would set the body text, while Gambarino would shine in the headlines. Gambarino’s serifs are exquisitely fine; they are paired with teardrop terminals, such as on the ‘a’, ‘f’, and ‘y’. The capital letters are top-heavy; the bowls and counterforms in the upper portions of each letter are larger than the lower ones. This is visible, especially, in the letters ‘B’, ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘P’, and ‘R’. The trait is not quite carried on into the lowercase, but the design of the ‘a’ really harmonises with these unique capital letters anyway. Gambarino’s lowercase features a tall x-height, and what can only be described as ‘microscopic’ descenders. The descenders are all much shorter than the font’s ascenders, and this is visible everywhere  except in the ‘g’, which employs a great trick in its design to keep the sizes of its two bowls balanced.","styles":[{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/ZINX7PW4XMYISLZAZKYY4QHYYHYNPKAV/Z54IGKTR4PBLA5KTYL3IDQZHFQPJJVNZ/6KBHT5NXCZVM6GHTPKGIR6DXZLQAYIFK","id":"3b6987e4-36b0-430d-9671-b8224e55d0dd","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1080,"body_height":null,"cap_height":740,"descending_leading":-180,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":550,"y_max":1080,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":10407,"views_recent":712},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":580,"range_left":300,"range_right":700},{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":500,"range_left":300,"range_right":700}],"category":"Serif","designers":[{"bio":"Paul Troppmar's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Paul Troppmar"}],"name":"Paul Troppmar"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ccmp"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Newspapers"},{"name":"Text"},{"name":"Books"},{"name":"Magazines"}],"id":"0be0d575-ed09-4d44-90df-c28ddb50fb10","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:33:23Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":true,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Gambetta","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

Its ten styles are spread across five weights, ranging from Light to Bold; each weight has an upright and a companion italic font on offer. Gambetta’s letterforms are drawn with diagonal stress, and they letters have visible contrast, too. The degree of contrast that is visible increases with every weight in the family. Several of the terminals on the strokes of Gambetta’s letterforms feature very prominent wedge-shapes. In the upright fonts’ uppercase, every vertical terminal has been designed with one of these ‘wedge terminals’. These have been left off of other letterforms, judiciously. For example, the lowercase ‘a’ in the upright fonts don’t have a top-left terminal. This decision results in ‘a’ counterforms that are quite open. The numerals in Gambetta are proportional lining figures; the top of the ‘3’ is very distinctive, as it is flat. The numeral height is slightly lower than that of the uppercase letters; the lowercase ascenders, in turn, are taller than the capitals. In Gambetta’s italic fonts, the lowercase ‘g’ is double-storey, while the ‘a’ is single-storey. The ear on the ‘g’ is a prominent diagonal stroke, and the top-right part of the ‘k’ is an open loop. Gambetta is intended for use in book design and in editorial design; the fonts come from Paul Troppmar.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/54LXI2OCUZKIGXGLIPZLVAKCWLEVCWJ5/SMBRL4FXBYZFKSDA2XRPY55FMWX246T3/XV7ESZCVQJEU7XKHJW4AOX3XECHBBT2B","id":"81f8c272-4179-4131-bb6e-04e2fe17e052","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":680,"descending_leading":-215,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":450,"y_max":930,"y_min":-290},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/IRIZVFO2UHI3QC7JVG4POXHIBG3CWFOL/7BTSPFB27IAXMIHAT72YQ63JRQ4RBE6G/ILBJATBRNJ556VYMTS5DDKBCKUGNCPEE","id":"313991d4-bc8a-4d32-8df0-669d10debe3d","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{},"weight":{"label":"Light

Its letterforms feel like the France of the 1950s; they are very orderly, but also a bit spritely. The letters’ apertures are very small, making the counter-forms in typeface feel like they are being completely enclosed within their surrounding characters. The General Sans family comes in twelve weights ranging from Extralight to Bold with complementary italics .<br><br>The lowercase letters’ ascenders rise up to the exact height of the tops of the capital letters. Each font has two versions for each numeral; the standard numerals are slightly smaller than that capital letters. The other numerals are substituted into all-caps text by the fonts’ case-sensitive OpenType feature. These alternate numerals are the same size as the capital letters. General Sans’s fonts also have a full range of superior and inferior numerals for the better setting of fractions. Many of General Sans’s capital letters seem very geometric. For example, the ‘G’ does not have a spur at its bottom-right, and the tail of the ‘Q’ is a simple, vertical stroke. The lowercase ‘a’ in the General Sans fonts is double-storey, while the ‘g’ is single-storey. The ‘f’ and ’t’ are very wide. The dots on the ‘i’ and ‘j’ – as well as the fonts’ dot-based punctuation and diacritical marks – are circular. General Sans is an excellent selection for use in branding, or in other kinds of corporate identity design.

The typeface is perfect for use in Branding and in Editorial Design projects – anywhere you need a sans that combines personality with clear, open, and instantly legible forms. Synonym’s letterforms are not as monolinear as those found in many other humanist sans serif designs. The stroke contrast in Synonym is particularly visible in the lowercase ‘a’. Like the fonts’ lowercase ‘g’, this letter is double-storied in all of the family’s weights. Several of the strokes in Synonym’s letterforms terminate in diagonals, rather than with horizontal or vertical cuts, such as the arms of the ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘L’, and ‘T’, the tops of the ascenders in the lowercase, and the in-strokes of ‘m’, ’n’, ‘r’, ‘t’, and ‘u’. The lowercase letters’ x-height is moderately positioned in relation to the capital letters, and the fonts’ ascenders rise up above the tops of the uppercase letters. The fonts’ numerals are lining – making them as tall of the capital letters – but they are proportionally-spaced, with the ‘1’ and the ‘7’, for instance, being narrower than the ‘0’ or ‘8’. Synonym is the work of Hugo Dumont, a type designer based in Paris.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/DWLDF76EZPJP6YRY5MHXTIXADWM5CMQ4/L7NK22M2DZFJAKYMM6XND26LIPTZKTGS/J2GX7J4D2FCU7L3RTOGLSQYP5DNR5NF7","id":"c4582791-1ca2-4991-a9da-1658245f016f","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":470,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Extralight","name":"Extralight","native_name":null,"number":200,"weight":200}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/KSR3BNNQT6EDHIEHW36SBE5BHCHOBS3B/5R2AM4YEUB37PBSUICUPJTP7OZUBUIJZ/3LQZJYXAXUFIFQJUAS4R5LI5GQXCZOKQ","id":"bbe3f2cf-1551-4a86-91f0-ac1c5b05aba9","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1730,"x_height":473,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/DFYGA7EPVEG7D7UPFPAIYFH2F4NM27PX/EVVPJ6WZV4QLGKO7KZL6GMJI3CXH433B/EMRNL4XMLBJQUVRD4I5XB7IIBFI5JC3Z","id":"7e7652a5-2adc-4ebd-accf-62ad801a8393","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1713,"x_height":478,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/FGFTDNARUVIBDKBH6IHNBOQNDT4HPTOW/DQI5KYN7O74HFIZJLVB36XBKUIAOAGYJ/DXASCID3BXP555YRRIR7LNOVRX77YPHC","id":"55808c70-f991-43c4-b905-5bca735394a2","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1690,"x_height":485,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/OLXBPT3HV3XOCH3GZ75POZQQZCOITSOK/PRXXQBEUWYC7F2NHKCW2Y26DH5XJSZWW/R55OPPYH4ZWP55QB6AHSS5YT3TLGUGNE","id":"43c961db-8c0d-4131-bc72-4a48e29c596b","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":705,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1663,"x_height":493,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Semibold","name":"Semibold","native_name":null,"number":600,"weight":600}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/M4NZQ2JCB6MXNBRDCL62PCUDE7GQYMSM/35C25Y5LCQENYUX4Z56WXZUM5HXPAB2L/LICKIETVGV4KBVZA3MNOBQA4VS4YJI7F","id":"b4b9933e-0ba1-4124-b026-a487a7ac054e","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":500,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/74H2KDWJMBALTKHNIQRGZBU5ICACXZVT/ELAHIXGEN3HHKQ7JK54VOXWQFZLLOHW2/37TO4J4G54TAREFY7PFS5VAXDGLM7BKV","id":"88bf0208-f07e-4611-bb6c-57398c0f878b","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1010,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":500,"y_max":1010,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":5605,"views_recent":312},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":550,"range_left":200,"range_right":900}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"Jean-Baptiste

The sides of each letter in Technor are flat. Many of the typeface’s characters have rounded tops and bottoms; however, in the case of letters where these are traditionally flat – like in ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘I’, ‘L’, and ‘T’ – Technor keeps these flat, too. The family’s range of weights begins with Extralight and expands to Black. In all of the fonts, characters are drawn with monolinear strokes. In each of the weights, the fonts’ inter-character spacing is very tight. Technor is a little wide, especially in the lowercase. The lowercase letters also have a tall x-height. For their design, simple forms have been favored. The ‘a’ and the ‘g’ are both single-storey, for instance.

It is great for things you want people to sink their teeth into. The font’s glyphs are a little wide, in terms of their proportion, and this makes them look robust. Sentient’s capital letters can all stand on their own, for instance – they do not look delicate, like a light breeze would blow them over. That visual stability helps Sentient hold up even under poor printing conditions. The letters’ counterforms are large and these features and more help Sentient look great on-screen, too. The italic ‘g’ has an iconic closed-bowl design. The italic ampersand also uses a different form than the upright fonts, which looks divine. Sentient’s default numerals are proportional lining figures; oldstyle figures are available via an OpenType alternate. There are 14 f-ligatures in each fonts’ OpenType features (liga and dlig), and Sentient includes a few more alternates as well. For instance, over the Stylistic Sets, users can reach an ‘M’ with straight sides, as well as an alternate ‘Q’ with a longer

It is intended for typesetting headlines in editorial design settings, as well as signage, the larger texts in exhibition graphics, or any other place where you need big, elegant-looking type. Boska takes inspiration both from straight-axis nineteenth century typefaces and pointed-pen calligraphy. Its letterforms contain a high degree of stroke-contrast; this gives them a look of sophistication. The family includes six weights, ranging in style from Light through Black. Each weight has both an upright font and an italic on offer. The fonts’ default numerals are proportionally-spaced oldstyle figures. Lining figures are also available, via an OpenType feature. Boska’s characters are all a bit condensed; this narrow feeling is especially present in the fonts’ uppercase letters. The ascenders of the lowercase letters rise slightly above the tops of the capitals. In the upright fonts, the ‘a’ and the ‘g’ are double-storied. In the italics, they are single-storied. Each font includes small caps, and 13 f-ligatures, too. Special characters in the fonts – such as the hashtag and the @-symbol, as well several punctuation marks and mathematical glyphs – are drawn with thin, monolinear hairline strokes, allowing them to disappear into the background somewhat, and let the real alphabetic characters shine more prominently.

It looks like it has taken letterforms drafted by engineers and crossed these with avant-garde remixes of typewriter faces. As a family, Expose includes four fonts, ranging in weight from Regular through Black. Newspaper headlines need to be compact, and the counters inside of Expose’s letters help the design achieve this by being almost squared off. Something similar happens with the diagonal strokes, too: several diagonals change direction towards one end of their stroke.

In almost every letter or numeral in the font whose form contains a straight line (a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal stroke), that line has been replaced with a zebra-striped pattern. This whimsical effect adds levity and ornament to any texts set with the font. Because of the size of the stripes in Striper’s patterns, the Striper font is best used in large sizes. The pattern will have more of an effect if one or just a few words of a headline are set with Striper, instead of many lines of text in succession. The Striper font has a large character set, with two alternate forms for each letter; these alternates may be accessed via the font’s OpenType Stylistic Sets. The first Stylistic Set offers letterforms with different basic skeletal shapes – i.e., the lowercase ‘a’ changes from being double-storey to single-storey – as well as offering letterforms with striped patterns in different parts of the characters. The second Stylistic Set features letters that are much wider. Striper’s second Stylistic Set is almost have having a second, extended font packaged inside the same font file! The ascenders on Striper’s lowercase letters rise up to the same height as the tops of the font’s capitals.

All of its letters are wide. They have been drawn with reverse contrast, so their horizontal elements are heavier than the vertical or diagonal strokes. This applies especially to Boxing’s serifs, which are heavy to the extreme. As stated a few sentences ago, this style of letter is often associated with the Wild-West-era of American history: westward expansion, gold rushes, the Civil War, Cowboys & Indians, and all that. However, letters like Boxing’s were also used on posters printed in mid-19th century Europe. They reappeared much later in the psychedelic graphics of the 1960s and 70s, too. So, the area of application for a typeface like this is broader than one might think at first glance. Boxing is a single-weight design by Ruosi Huang, and its name certainly calls boxing posters to mind. Nevertheless, its area of use today can also encompass flyers, logo design, or newspaper headlines.

Pilcrow Rounded include five weights: Regular through Heavy. In keeping with the design’s mechanical nature, the family does not include Italics, as Pilcrow’ Rounded's style of letter fits better with typographic hierarchies using contrasting weights to define emphasis, whereas Italics use slants or a cursive stroke pattern. Pilcrow Rounded’s glyphs have square-like proportions, although most of them are narrower than perfect squares. While the typeface does have a monospaced feeling in longer passages of text, the glyphs are proportionally-spaced. Each glyph’s width increases just slightly as one goes up the family’s weight scale. A benefit of typefaces created for utilitarian purposes is that their clean and simple letterforms often increase legibility onscreen. Pilcrow Rounded is particularly suited for short texts on websites or for news-ticker scrollbars on television. Because of web 2.0-style logos that have been popular in the past decade, Pilcrow Rounded appears particularly suited for use in ‘tech’ applications. <br><br>Pilcrow Rounded is part of Pilcrow family that comes in three variants: Pilcrow, Pilcrow Soft and Pilcrow Rounded. <a href=\"https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/pilcrow\">Pilcrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/pilcrow-soft\">Pilcrow Soft</a> are paid fonts (and can be purchased from Indian Type Foundry's website), whereas Pilcrow Rounded is distributed for free exclusively through Fontshare.

Its weights range from Light to Bold. Even in Melodrama Light, the vertical strokes in letters seem about twice as thick as the horizontals. Each weight in the family increases the thickness of those thicker strokes, while the thins stay just the same. That means that, as you go up the weight scale, you get more and more contrast with each style. The best feature in Melodrama is probably the number of decorative ligatures it includes. These include more than three dozen uppercase pairs, like a ‘CH’ where part of the ‘H’ is inside the ‘C’, and several L-ligatures with the bottom the ‘L’ extending under superscript-like letters. You can also have the ‘O’ partially overlap the ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘O’, or ‘Q’. The lowercase letters get to join in the ligature fun, too. As a sans serif, Melodrama is also a rather geometric typeface. Letters like ‘C’ and ‘G’ are nearly circular, just like the ‘O’, ‘Q’, ‘c’, and ‘e’. Most other letters are much narrower. The lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ are double-storied. Oldstlye figures can be substituted as alternates for the fonts’ standard lining figures.

The strokes of its glyphs are just one-unit thick. As far as we’re aware, that makes Kohinoor One the thinnest retail (or open-source) font currently available in the market (indeed. there are fonts available elsewhere with strokes that are four or even two units wide). Kohinoor One is an addition to Kohinoor Multiscript – ITF’s oldest superfamily. As a series of fonts, Kohinoor was designed in a humanist sans serif style suitable for body text and display text, too. It is an all-around typeface for graphic designers, software engineers, and branding specialists. Thanks to its clear appearance, Kohinoor is easy to work with and inviting to read. Begun with the goal of supporting all of the major Indian languages while harmoniously translating a single design aesthetic across each writing system, Kohinoor Multiscript currently supports over 150 languages that are spoken natively by 3.5 billion people. The superfamily is an ideal choice for text-heavy multilingual projects, including those from the areas of corporate design, electronic-embedding in apps, navigation or signage systems, print publications, product instruction manuals, and television subtitling.\n\nKohinoor Zero is a base for designers to make their own creative digital lettering. You decide yourself what kind of outline to apply to the skeleton of the letters. The concept was to offer designers a font whose glyphs were just single strokes. Yet, it is impossible to export single strokes from a font editor and install that as a font in your operating system. Many designers already draw single-stroke lettering in applications like Illustrator and then space and kern the letters in that lettering themselves. But as a workflow that is slow and not ideal. At ITF, we came up with a work-around. We “temporarily” closed the counters of all the letters by a straight line and aligned these nodes as the same place under the baseline. Because that resulted in closed-shape forms, we could export those outlines as a proper OpenType font. To work with Kohinoor Zero, you first need to set text in an app like InDesign or Illustrator. Then, you convert that text into outlines. Finally, you must delete all the nodes below the descender line. That leaves you with simple outlines. Remove the fill color and apply the stroke, brush, or outline of your choice. Satya Rajpurohit began developing Kohinoor Zerone more than a dozen years ago. He first presented the idea at TypeCon 2010 in Los Angeles.

Its lowercase letters are a new digital/calligraphic take on traditional ‘gothic’ or textura-style forms. They look very much like the kinds of letters used on a lot of newspaper nameplates, or for certificate and diploma designs. Aktura’s uppercase is much more ornate; you could call the letters ‘lombardic’ capitals. Since gothic letterforms, historically speaking, were something of a unicase writing system – they were only really paired with matching caps after printing came along in the 15th century – Aktura reaches back to an occasional form of style-mixing practiced in the past, in which lombardic caps were used as the uppercase forms for gothic lowercase letters. The lombardic caps are so elaborate that they should almost never be used to set all-caps text; however, if you apply a lot of tracking, you might be able to get away with this for a logo, or in a headline that is about three-words-long. They will work just fine when they are used as presented in this font: as uppercase letters for otherwise mixed-case text. Aktura’s lombardic caps are a bit more calligraphic and playful than lombardic caps you might find in fonts based on more-specific historical source material. Like all ornamental capitals, Aktura’s uppercase can also be used as drop caps or initial letters for body text set in an otherwise completely different font, especially if that other font is a serif typeface, good for setting long passages of text.Aktura is a single-weight typeface designed by Gaetan Baehr.","styles":[{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/NIVDH3M5EHMOFQLFSO44DGIVRSURZ2LO/UBHE7HWG6SMKX5EOD4TITKPDUJOMJVMC/UI4W6M6UVXNFLVDCI5G55QMMEE26RWQZ","id":"780c8b5f-cdc0-444d-9688-7f8e2d7df7f9","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":940,"body_height":null,"cap_height":814,"descending_leading":-297,"max_char_width":2338,"x_height":500,"y_max":940,"y_min":-400},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":5295,"views_recent":501},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":260,"range_left":100,"range_right":900}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"Alisa Nowak's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Alisa Nowak"}],"name":"Alisa Nowak"},{"bio":"Jérémie Hornus's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Jérémie Hornus"}],"name":"Jérémie Hornus"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"rvrn"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Magazines"},{"name":"Posters"},{"name":"Branding"},{"name":"Books"}],"id":"1ae36b89-ae95-45f1-b429-ca314a9b1684","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:15:50Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":false,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Alpino","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

All of the design’s letterforms are made up of dots on a grid. The capital letters in each of the fonts are 10 dots tall. Lowercase letters like the “a”, which does not have an ascender or descender, are eight dots tall. Ascending lowercase letters are one dot taller than the capitals, so the “b” and “d” are 11 dots high. Descending letters like the “j” and the “g” have two dots that drop below the baseline. There are some characters, such as the Euro currency symbol, which dip below the baseline in order to accommodate all of the necessary “parts” on the Array grid, too. As a family, Array has a total of six fonts on offer. There are three “weights”: Regular, Medium, and Bold. The dots are the same size in each. As the weight of the family increases, the letterforms simply get wider. For example, as you move from Regular to Medium to Bold, the widths of the letters’ stems increase: the stems of Array’s Regular letters are two dots wide, while the Medium stems have three dots, and the Bold four. Each of the family’s weights has two “widths” available: normal and wide. Most of the widths of the letterforms in the three wide fonts are similar to those from the normal fonts, but with added space on their sides. The total width of the text that is wider in the Array Wide fonts, rather than the shapes of all letterforms themselves. Some characters are spaced and kerned differently in Array Wide, however, such as the “v”. Array was developed for Fontstore by Frode Helland, a Norwegian designer with several typefaces in our collection. The family is ideal for use in experimental graphic design. Its fonts could also be used on actual electronic displays, as well as in print or online editorial projects, especially in places where the fonts may be used in large sizes.\n","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/4QBZHM3FOPYBI67YBLLWZV6ZYIUQTKEE/RXSUFPNEA6YXGQDMHMP3OODY6UWXRJBM/C6VM2RT4EU2NNT5XZWVYHR7WOIOGM4EU","id":"56bfc2a4-3bb3-4aac-862e-3055576d881d","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1400,"body_height":null,"cap_height":1000,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":2000,"x_height":800,"y_max":1400,"y_min":-300},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/V53YESOWYHBUNRPDB3QFLMVKNMB6BRHT/BZTHQEU54BMF7N2Z6P3HZPM5DJ3WYKKB/HU6RK3235LIDCC3OMCBSE6JYJ4OS5FSR","id":"12f3a10b-7003-4b1a-90cb-2549f5d0f007","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1400,"body_height":null,"cap_height":1000,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":2100,"x_height":800,"y_max":1400,"y_min":-300},"weight":{"label":"Wide","name":"Wide","native_name":null,"number":401,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/CASMZPM4VVUC7LKMFQX5SR6SI2NXI6WK/JAJOL32XMCA7KL72O3CN6EMCO3THGWPV/N2P4YTB27O7OQQY6FVFUL232EUHLL7SR","id":"bcade387-7759-4bb3-814c-4c039d5d5469","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1400,"body_height":null,"cap_height":1000,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":2400,"x_height":800,"y_max":1400,"y_min":-300},"weight":{"label":"Semibold","name":"Semibold","native_name":null,"number":600,"weight":600}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/DSANEM3KIIR7IXN4VX6EKUD4F7XOGKK2/QOLMLC5QOSGYNFXUP4ZW37PMF3TWYKN7/UVB4QMHQ4S3AW3BLSY5UCVAUUR3X3HNX","id":"76549902-5050-43c8-8370-ffff182f2ccd","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1400,"body_height":null,"cap_height":1000,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":2500,"x_height":800,"y_max":1400,"y_min":-300},"weight":{"label":"Semibold

They are optimised for use in modern publications – hence the the name ‘Author.’ Its letterforms are slightly expanded, which gives the counterforms inside of them enough space to breathe, thus increasing their legibility and helps with their on-screen rendering, too. Author’s family includes six weights, ranging from Extralight through Bold. Each weight has an upright and an italic font on offer. The uppercase letters are virtually monolinear in appearance; however, several of the lowercase letters have visible stroke contrast. The tops of Author’s strokes terminate in diagonal cuts; these are reminiscent of the broad-pen that would be used to write the humanist letterforms the typeface is based on. In Author’s upright fonts, the lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ are double-storied; there is a single-storey ‘g’ in the fonts as an OpenType alternate. In the italic fonts, the ‘a’ and the ‘g’ are both single-storied. The ascenders of Author’s lowercase letters a slightly taller than the tops of the capitals. The family’s fonts include both lining and oldstyle figures; in both versions, the ‘3’ has a flat top. Author comes from Satya Rajpurohit, the founder of Fontshare and Indian Type Foundry.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/T5F6NVD6O4TC3BBWJPV7SKNCWINXKUH3/IXOW2725PVZYHEKOVD7F7DOFWHVOSE5Z/NE5GNDCLYQFHVFCP2GGFATDUJXLCCQMZ","id":"1e6e4905-46e2-4a10-8e3f-39526ecc5d76","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":830,"body_height":null,"cap_height":595,"descending_leading":-185,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":440,"y_max":830,"y_min":-200},"weight":{"label":"Extralight","name":"Extralight","native_name":null,"number":200,"weight":200}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/E2IOUYSC3GOBVNTCJZQYKGQATBTJHHJE/Y545T22HRHZAPXFEHNALZAA74KAAZ42G/7HDRRT2TV3TVGOYBOWNSKJOG6NOMMCGN","id":"412b1611-c870-4387-a21b-18621393d8cd","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":830,"body_height":null,"cap_height":595,"descending_leading":-185,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":440,"y_max":830,"y_min":-200},"weight":{"label":"Extralight

This kind of diagonal stroke-ending is visible throughout the typeface’s design. It acts as a subtle reference to the kind of broad-pen that could be used to write Bespoke Sans’s letterforms out. The lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ in the five upright fonts are double-storied. In the italic fonts, these become single-storied. The fonts’ numerals are proportionally-spaced oldstyle figures, which harmonise especially well with the lowercase letters. Bespoke Sans is an excellent choice for use in branding, corporate communication, editorial design, and even in signage and wayfinding systems.

The serifs at the end of the letterforms’ strokes are wedge-shaped. The letterforms themselves feature large and open counterforms, which help maximise the typeface’s legibility. The family includes five weights, ranging from Light through Bold. Each weight has an upright and an italic font on offer. While the characters in the italic fonts are not simply slanted (or oblique) versions of the upright ones, Bespoke Serif’s italic is not entirely cursivised. The lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ change  the most visibly between the uprights and italics. Their upright forms are double-storied, but in the italic, they become single-storied. The fonts’ numerals are proportionally-spaced oldstyle figures, which harmonise especially well with lowercase letters. Together with Bespoke Sans and Bespoke Sans Stencil, the Bespoke Serif fonts form a proper series that you could call ‘the Bespoke superfamily.’ This is an excellent choice for use in branding, corporate communication, or editorial design. It will get messages across quickly. The fonts in the Bespoke superfamily are a real team effort; they were designed by Jeremie Hornus, Theo Guillard, Morgane Pambrun, Alisa Nowak, and Joachim Vu.

They feature large, open counterforms, which hep maximise the typeface’s legibility in text. The family includes five weights, ranging from Light through Bold. Each weight has an upright and an italic font on offer. The tops of the Bespoke Slab’s lowercase ascenders all end in diagonal shears. This kind of diagonal stroke-ending is visible throughout the typeface’s design. It acts as a subtle reference to the kind of broad-pen that could be used to write Bespoke Slab’s letterforms out. The lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ in the five upright fonts are double-storied. In the italic fonts, these become single-storied. The fonts’ numerals are proportionally-spaced oldstyle figures, which harmonise especially well with the lowercase letters. Bespoke Slab is an excellent choice for use in branding, corporate communication, editorial design, and even in signage and wayfinding systems. It gets a text’s message across quickly – no matter if the text is long or short – without sacrificing its own unique and inherent voice. The Bespoke Slab fonts are a real team effort; they were designed by Jérémie Hornus, Théo Guillard, Morgane Pambrun, Alisa Nowak, and Joachim Vu.\n","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/YPIGAYB6RXGCGNEEHRCW6MCDE4OWVMTO/NU6AY22ZZW2RA3AU4EYNLT5A5XSUFVEB/K7LIBZMHVQLHFYESUQRV33UETTTVDV6W","id":"9541ee3a-79b8-4f7b-bec2-095f8b0493fd","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":500,"y_max":980,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/CMUDPKIGUNTIJ3Z5G5Y7F2HX2CQ4KSJT/GUW3R47AJQYCMFQLKYXWW54ML37BIAEA/H7IJ6WLSPXDKRRPRM2IBDTWJJFSQ4V7B","id":"f36398ec-94cd-45a9-8769-52687266a532","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":500,"y_max":980,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Light

It can lend a unique voice to the larger-sized texts in posters, brochures, website headlines and apps. A lot of Chubbo’s expressiveness and friendly-nature comes from the forms of its slab serifs themselves. These all end in rounded terminals, giving the typeface a soft feeling. The family encompasses five weights ranging in stroke thickness from ExtraLight to Bold. Each Chubbo weight has a complementary italic, too. Chubbo’s italics are even livelier than its upright fonts. The fonts’ characters are not sloped versions of the upright forms. Instead, they are redrawn in a more cursive style. Inside the italics, the stroke of the pen is kept. They are the most exciting contribution type designer Rafał Buchner brought to the project. Aside from Chubbo’s availability as ten ‘classic’ fonts, the design also ships as two Variable Fonts. There is one Variable Font for Chubbo’s upright styles and another for its italics.\n\nIn each style, the fonts’ strokes are optically monolinear. Some letters in the italic styles’ lowercase prove the exception, to strengthen their script-like appearance. Chubbo’s upright fonts have double-storey ‘a’ and ‘g’ forms per default. A single-storey ‘g’ is available as an alternate. In the italics, the ‘a’ and ‘g’ are always single-storey. Through an Opentype feature, you can replace the default forms of Chubbo’s ‘g’ and ‘y’ with alternates. The descenders of the standard italic ‘g’ and ‘y’ have closed loops; alternate glyphs provide open forms for those two letters. In both the upright and italic styles, the default ‘G’ has a curled beard that descends below the baseline, but there is a version with a straight, non-descending beard available as an alternate. All Chubbo fonts also have an alternate dollar sign where the stroke does not bisect the entire S-form.\n\nWith more than 390 glyphs per font, Chubbo supports all of the characters needed for European languages written with the Latin script. Chubbo’s lowercase letters have a moderate x-height, but their ascenders rise above the tops of the fonts’ capitals. The fonts feature interior forms that are clear and legible, no matter their total size. The typeface will lend a lively voice to any situation it is applied

Set headlines with it online or in print. Chillax would also be an excellent choice for embedding in a cultural or lifestyle app. Although its letterforms might look slightly decorative at first glance, Chillax has a high modernist pedigree. Manushi Parikh did not design the typeface in just any geometric direction: Chillax is a ‘Bauhaus’-style typeface. Its lowercase letters are designed directly along a pattern established in 1926 by Herbert Bayer as part of his ‘Universal’ alphabet. Since Bayer’s ideas explored unicase possibilities, they had no capital letters. The uppercase in Chillax is Parikh’s addition. \n\nAs installable fonts, Chillax is available either as a family of six fonts or a single Variable Font file. The standard font-format family offers predefined weights ranging from ExtraLight to Bold. Meanwhile, the Variable Font is even more versatile. Its weight axis allows you to pick the exact stroke thickness desired from hundreds of subtly different grades. No matter which font format you install, Chillax includes several alternate letterforms that you can substitute into your text via the fonts’ OpenType features. For instance, the Standard Alternates and the Stylistic Set 1 feature each swap in rounder forms for the uppercase ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘D’, ‘M’, ‘N’, ‘V’, ‘W’, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’. It also activates the lowercase letters ‘v’, ‘w’, ‘z’ and the numeral ‘3’. Those features substitute open-counter alternate forms for the ‘K’, ‘R’, ‘X’, ‘k’ and ‘x’ as well. Stylistic Set 2 activates even more-iconic letterforms. Its alternates for the ‘A’, ‘K’, ‘Y’ and ‘k’ look like the letters Bayer designed for the signage on the Bauhaus building in Dessau. \n\nWith more than 440 glyphs per font, Chillax supports all of the characters needed for European languages written with the Latin script. The x-height of Chillax’s lowercase letters is tall. Ascenders rise above the tops of the fonts’ capital letters. All this allows the interior counter forms in Chillax’s glyphs to be large. They are open and read clearly. Thanks to that, even the more decorative alternates are always legible.\n","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/VPEI4URMTKIBEJ3ML5QGYTUN7QZSA7PZ/X6BNVDN4VAFADO6MXX3KIYTEI47EOMBE/DT44ALCE3XZMBI43JDI76R6HUUPFXQXV","id":"de22e0f2-5762-4ea0-a8a7-dd521f8850c9","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":665,"descending_leading":-220,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":480,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Extralight","name":"Extralight","native_name":null,"number":200,"weight":200}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/SVYQ5C47KQ7Q4A6527WD7JA6PUG6HK55/I2UFEJWWBDNRZ5HKD3V4ASSUY3YYEMOJ/JEWCW7XRBNTGIANRIQOD4DIZJG4HEHFJ","id":"6a613750-99eb-4889-ba9d-dfe9fe5520d3","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":666,"descending_leading":-221,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":482,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/WSPWZKQM26GGKSLVGSP2CFUHUMS5BCYQ/UE3YJANJM3SE3IWT4TOMYQVMLCQ6GZGG/XESIRBQU62YFBC7YQZI6D2NT5CNZ4PPU","id":"d815f77c-c342-4df1-a610-e0c04164ebfd","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":668,"descending_leading":-223,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":485,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/XASL35KKT35X3ACCBCOQKKABSR6AT3FX/6MU5BWUUPHCFUHM2F3E3QPQGKXCVBUOO/WZY5PMNTII6NKOB2TTIAX7QVAWMSY2DQ","id":"abe03890-a277-41a2-a532-013a1b4e9f38","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-225,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":490,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/2T24MWUOKZU65SZJ33GPRGNOKE4KPOBX/T6LIXZJIPB23UDPMTIKURYWSZLXZBJ3A/THF5L6EHVL4N4NNE3GYDZNZSHABL5CH5","id":"55424eac-dbde-47cf-87a1-b7913f89939d","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":673,"descending_leading":-228,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":495,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Semibold","name":"Semibold","native_name":null,"number":600,"weight":600}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/UM553GIXLG5E46TUH763VYPGAQ77BPQ5/NN4EI53RUGC4BO5HP5F46SYQ4WY4U4CE/T2KA2X72VGASVXFVB7QCOIFYVH5GZJTW","id":"4573610a-bf77-4444-aa4c-40fdd25f0a70","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":675,"descending_leading":-230,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/ZYDQ23QUC5RIWZP2XNQDB6EQIKJAJRWI/OQWULF7QT4HTMBH6W3XY6DESOSZLWT3L/7L7IIHAKMJC3Z2MTNHMMKSRMMTKZN4OJ","id":"3bb42080-aeb3-4fb5-9243-a0ab2e2349c2","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":675,"descending_leading":-230,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":980,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":37835,"views_recent":2811},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":660,"range_left":100,"range_right":900}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"ITF's

In terms of design, Cabinet Grotesk is a sans; however, its letters feature of kind of stroke-contrast that set them apart from other sans serifs. The family includes eight styles, which range in weight from Thin through Extrabold – even the Thin weight maintains the family’s stroke-contrast model. As Cabinet Grotesk’s fonts get heavier, the stroke-contrast becomes most-prominent in the letterforms’ stroke connections. These get quite a ‘pinched’ look. Cabinet Grotesk’s numerals are proportional lining figures, and just as tall as the tops of the uppercase letters. The lowercase’s ascenders rise up to the common capital/numeral height, too. The letters ‘a’ and ‘g’ are double-storey by default, but single-storey variants are available via Stylistic Sets. The fonts also include several other unique OpenType features, including case-sensitive punctuation, 19 ligatures, a special form of the ‘IJ’ for the Dutch language (including the ‘IJ’ with acute accents over both the ‘I’ and the ‘J’), as well as alternate versions of the ‘Ä’ and ‘Ü’ that feature lowered dots. Cabinet Grotesk’s broad number of weights, combined with its eye-catching stroke-contrast, make it an ideal choice for use in editorial design.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/NIIR3NEHQKIQOXM5XYK6QJLKH4X3KG62/AX34VRDX5YTCCLBUIUJM5MM7UKX5FEHX/ECITT5TPSBHAOYX64V52JQWO6WMUKKQG","id":"e22115e2-f2b0-4d2e-af84-42c9732e51da","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":474,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Thin","name":"Thin","native_name":null,"number":100,"weight":100}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/7A2ZM26AN76BCF6P4KAJGJXKQ2WDOLCJ/LR57NCTD3SD7IIEZFNZHIXC2IWB6IGA3/7NVJZOT4VDOND7ERAOUP2CFTQCITWQFH","id":"8a957c16-dec8-42bd-a896-e745b9afa9f1","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":476,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Extralight","name":"Extralight","native_name":null,"number":200,"weight":200}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/7GWNQ5AHAZORLOWZ7ELKPLOIQITAR5S5/NYLYMGXMB4RANWVNJSIHG2IKPZ44CN5E/MT4CWVHB3N2C6KFUZ75QK4JQ2FYK4J4M","id":"1cc65be9-6429-434b-a4da-7be277cc59c5","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":478,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/J6PPRPKWXDUIYA47IXLEQB4R4OPVYDQH/N2ZXAXWEHVMLISD2TIXJC7EF4GOY43L4/NXM4Z4TDCMYWBZ7AVI2N6DQ5VMWNENMU","id":"b7ffe0f1-2c30-46d8-be71-00cf2d255416","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":480,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/CKQBK2QBTCDREE7L3MXZ3PPW7LDNJCWU/OTOY7FQFSFOJVZKJWKO2EHUJLOGBDN4Q/4CO2ETY7NITKLUDKMYJ75RHJSPHOJ7XT","id":"54e0e7b8-fe6b-40b4-bd6f-0719b18c120e","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":484,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/XMXWOHABYLQDJ42L65EFRYNVRY37HQCB/B2O4O6V3JMFM2WDCYQI3A47L5U4THDUL/WN5274VQ3AUBDFP74GB4EC4XYJ3EKVNE","id":"4a8873b5-57ab-471e-926e-5f6f08c76c37","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1714,"x_height":487,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/ZX6AQLSFYVDPN2URWO2MQFGTYYOHIS64/TPYPKOYWFQVNJHLLRXD4KFYX4LUOUW4Z/6QH2ALVTTK7IRVO5MYOQQ3OZNXW5SSS3","id":"a8bede86-be3f-4240-9cda-6ef77bd431eb","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":870,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-186,"max_char_width":1680,"x_height":490,"y_max":870,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Extrabold

Unlike other typefaces inspired by the pointed pen, capital letters have been kept rather simple, without loops or flourishes. That way, the used can even use words in all-caps if wanted.

The letterforms are very condensed. They also contain a lot of stroke-contrast. Bonny’s thin strokes often terminate in flourishes; these flourishes pair well with the typeface’s serifs, which are both thin and short. Bonny’s uppercase letters are very top-heavy; the upper halves of ‘B’, ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘H’, ‘K’, ‘M’, ‘R’, ‘S’, and ‘X’ are so large that they look almost like caricatures. This feature is carried over the some of the lowercase letters, too. For example, Bonny’s ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘k’, ‘r’, ‘s’, ‘t’, ‘y’, and ‘z’ are all extravagant and lovely. The ‘v’ and ‘w’ have calligraphic flourishes on their right-hand sides; similar expressions appear throughout rest of the the typeface, too. Each font includes 13 f-ligatures. An alternate ‘j’ may be automatically substituted into text, via the Contextual Alternates feature, preventing collisions with glyphs coming before it. The fonts’ numerals are oldstyle figures, which match the rhythm of the lowercase letters. From the Polish type designer Barbara Bigosinska, Bonny is an excellent choice for use on greeting cards and in packaging design. Its fonts should be set in large point sizes, so that its details have enough space to really shine.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/MHFDJS6MVWLPWIQSQAT5X4Q7OZRIMFHV/4JRORKO5YDWLLTCHIRR2JJFRCFU4MWSF/X2P4PI5ID6PPLWXQ6M24K3EMN7BWPY3S","id":"aff58505-0408-4b8b-af6b-bab085cc2cb3","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":725,"descending_leading":-190,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":533,"y_max":930,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Thin","name":"Thin","native_name":null,"number":100,"weight":100}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/45K6SNT3ZP7P4C3XXV6JTV3WO22NSOQK/5YOTUF3XODAVRT5CH2APUNKARL2O7OOO/T6HDSSPAFZI3JERC73DCTKMVHT4AH2G2","id":"e25166af-9666-4813-a841-078c9cc6925c","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":725,"descending_leading":-190,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":536,"y_max":930,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/AG6QG7FHAEVDKFUVQI74UJNPIUIME6ZL/DLJCIGBUV5C2CKF4VAKQEQU4BYSBGDOJ/K4WM2XCCNWATUKRUC45COB2XDN52TUYD","id":"c31bbb1a-c461-4eba-9691-18942b007e72","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":725,"descending_leading":-190,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":538,"y_max":930,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/QUUFXN4SI535SFEFAH2RXEGYGRN3LAJH/HCD6CG6ZYEB2YZZVJTG37G5VE3XUCMUR/3LWNDZX7GKDA6F23JNKWTOATL5636NFF","id":"6d010181-598e-4a39-bab7-0c998530bb5c","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":725,"descending_leading":-190,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":537,"y_max":930,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/WON4DLF7543VWEEJYTPJYIR577RRLDUJ/KGIXYEFWOEJU3VCSKA62ZVKS46EFHP75/V6D52R6BLS7NWVT43T2QEVIGKASQC35W","id":"797b5a27-a3c6-42ef-9e43-cdc8b52abeb1","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":725,"descending_leading":-190,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":540,"y_max":930,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/54SKSKI7YBD36HX6IW6MWAFAHT5YX7WD/OWFVI2CCZSAXMG2NMPCOTDTZKXM4B3PI/CASLO45BYLBMVVOVKUXUAR7GJFAN52DK","id":"62757cce-73c4-41fa-88e0-0098a4f6f48b","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":930,"body_height":null,"cap_height":725,"descending_leading":-190,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":515,"y_max":930,"y_min":-260},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":5505,"views_recent":333},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":820,"range_left":100,"range_right":900}],"category":"Display","designers":[{"bio":"Arya

Formal reduction \nalso plays a strong role in Bevellier’s design. Its simplicity is \nvisible in letters like the lowercase ’t’, where the crossbar does not \ngo across the letter’s entire vertical stroke. Bevellier’s letters are \nalso ‘spurless’; you can see this feature on the top-left corners of \nletters like ‘m’, ‘n’, and ‘r’. Normally, the letters’ vertical \nstrokes would peak up above the left-hand sides of those letters’ \narches, but the ‘spurs’ have been eliminated here. The Bevellier \nfamily includes eight weights, which range from Extralight to Black. \nEach weight has two fonts on offer: an upright and an italic. Just \nlike Bevellier’s upright fonts, Bevellier’s italics are spurless. \nHowever, the italic letterforms are more symmetrical than the upright \nletters. The parts of Bevellier’s upright letterforms that have \nmissing ‘spurs’ are angular; in the italics, they are curved. The \nstrokes of Bevellier’s letterforms all appear to be monolinear. but \nthat doesn’t mean Bevellier is without contrast. Thanks to the \nfamily’s large number of weights – eight really is a lot – you can \ncombine two or more of them with each other to create headlines that \nexhibit quite a bit of contrast! Bevellier’s lowercase letters have a \nvery tall x-height. The fonts’ short ascenders rise to the same height \nas the tops of the capital letters. The fonts’ numerals are \nproportional lining figures; in terms of size, they are lower than \nBevellier’s uppercase, but still taller than the lowercase letters. \nBevellier’s friendly and somewhat technical look makes it an ideal \nchoice for use in branding, editorial design, and poster design.

Ulanovsky began this project in 2010 while a post-graduate student of typeface design at the FADU, University of Buenos Aires. She launched it as a Kickstarter project in 2011, in order to complete the first public release and share it with the world through Google Fonts.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Since then it has been developed by Julieta in collaboration with several designers. In 2015, a full set of weights and italics were developed by Julieta in collaboration with Ale Paul, Carolina Giovagnoli, Andrés Torresi, Juan Pablo del Peral and Sol Matas. In 2017, Jacques Le Bailly reworked the entire Latin design, and in parallel Juan Pablo del Peral and Sol Matas developed the initial Cyrillic extension with review and advise from Maria Doreuli and Alexei Vanyashin. Technical reviews were made by Lasse Fister, Kalapi GajjarBordawekar and Marc Foley.

The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design. The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print.

Unlike a traditional Spencerian-script fonts, Pencerio’s letterforms are made from thin, monolinear strokes. These bring the formality of the past into the digital future. Calligraphers write Spencerian letters at a slant (or slope), are formed with a pointed pen. The natural state of each stroke is a thin hairline. When a calligrapher wants to create a thicker line to provide contrast, all she needs to do is add pressure to the nib at the right point of the stroke. But what if she does not want to apply contrast? You can see the answer to that question right here. Pencerio is an excellent choice for any formal occasion that needs a more contemporary typographic take. It is sure to shine on calling cards, certificates, invitations, and anything associated with weddings. Pencerio’s lowercase letters have a very large x-height. The swash-like parts of its capital letters are taller than the lowercase’s ascenders. This lively, legible and noble typeface was designed by Manushi Parikh.\n\nIn the Spencerian model, uppercase letters are characterised by a peculiar ornateness, and this is reflected in Pencerio, too. Almost all capital letters include multiple loops, swells, and swirls. Some characters have additional details – like n ‘A’ and ‘K’ – and others have long, descending swash elements. Particularly the out-strokes of the ‘L’ and ‘Q’ can be used to create powerful word shapes. There is also an alternate version of the ‘L’ featuring a bottom stroke that does not descend below the baseline. Pencerio’s character set includes 675 glyphs, or almost double the amount necessary to transcribe all commonly-spoken European languages written with the Latin script. Most of the approximately 300 ‘extra’ glyphs are alternates that can be swapped into your text on the fly to create ligatures. This functionality should work automatically, as long as the standard ligatures OpenType feature is activated in your layout app or defined in your CSS file.","styles":[{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/JHTMMCH42STA2QSQ6HJIQLXVF5XYKGE2/U7SO7OYKWR7QDMUV5H3TFNDGCROM57MD/G56XYV46EA2SFVLDSUV5YAPQZC3YE3ID","id":"02a1af31-aaae-490b-8ca6-28edfc1292b6","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":950,"body_height":null,"cap_height":764,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1173,"x_height":480,"y_max":950,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Hairline","name":"Hairline","native_name":null,"number":50,"weight":50}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.1","views":8022,"views_recent":512},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":260,"range_left":200,"range_right":800}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"Barbara Bigosinska's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Barbara Bigosinska"}],"name":"Barbara Bigosinska"},{"bio":"Hitesh Malaviya's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Hitesh Malaviya"}],"name":"Hitesh Malaviya"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Editorial"},{"name":"Magazines"},{"name":"Posters"},{"name":"Books"}],"id":"ece21213-4ccd-44a0-aac5-265219bb18d2","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:36:57Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":true,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Panchang","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

The typeface features letters so wide that they are almost panoramic. The family supports all European languages written with the Latin script. Panchang’s lowercase letters have a tall x-height, and their ascenders are visibly taller than the capitals. The design’s broad letterforms look very industrial on the whole. Most terminals end with horizontal and vertical strokes, giving them a clean and streamlined look. There are a few exceptions to keep texts from becoming too monotonous. For instance, the diagonal stroke endings on the ‘C’, ‘S’, ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘g’, ‘s’, ‘6’ and ‘9’. Additionally, you will find these on the top half of the ‘G’, ‘f’ and ‘2’, as well as on the bottom of the ‘J’, ‘j’, ‘t’, ‘y’, ‘5’ and part of the ‘3’. Another surprise in the otherwise technical-looking typeface is the lowercase ‘y’, whose form is rounded. This allows it to take a wide stance, just like the rest of Panchang’s character set. A number of fine details stand out in the fonts: ‘a’ and the ‘g’ both take single-storey forms.

Its three weights were designed by Jean-Baptiste Morizot. Pally’s letterforms are all a bit wobbly; the angles of many letters’ strokes are atypical – just look at the capital ‘A’ – and the left and right-hand-sides of many letters are not the same size or height (e.g., the lowercase ‘a’ and ‘n’). As a result, Pally has a lot more character than most sans serif typefaces. It could be an excellent choice for headlines or signage in children’s services projects, like family centers, pediatricians’ offices, primary schools, etc. Once you begin to understand the different rhythm that Pally offers, its underlying typographic sophistication becomes clear. The ascenders of the lowercase letters, rise above the heights of capital letters and numerals. The lowercase alphabet includes a double-storey ‘a’, a single-storey ‘g’, and a Jensonian ‘e’, with a diagonal stroke in its middle-section. Each Pally weight has been drawn in a more-or-less monolinear fashion. In the fonts’ extended character sets, there is plenty of space between each letter and diacritics that come on top of it.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/H7RRPPQUKUZD2RCEKOG2EUWW2PMPGIYT/CUKSXG3REB7ZF4OU6YXUM2U3W5NYEU3I/CEHOWZ3P4TA7OGFSEAUC7EPX7SYRE24V","id":"e0e1a5fb-06b0-4fef-b684-5f28c7190f46","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-210,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":980,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/PNZYLAZIWZGWSDKVWN7N3EFNNI7IKEIS/76V4OFN3WI2NMZTXX5EY2GKDEZ6G4ACO/M6G3U44JEMF4HNADZG3WKRAKS2U5VMIO","id":"f18edce7-d3e8-486d-85a5-7b95609a2571","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-210,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":530,"y_max":980,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/V5WYWD27XO3LMOQ4EG2MQK4FRPTA5QJ2/ISQNWVNKUKTQCSPRHYNOUSUBYEKTLRCT/T66H3U7F4BLCEXDVQJD4H2MBK7CL3FOD","id":"c3c5a3fc-15ed-4f33-bcf2-355bc88fe03f","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-210,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":540,"y_max":980,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/VPAWN3GT4VFQHSY4UNTQ2DN7MTCY4SY6/BWT7ZBMMCUWVMKW5JKBRY5QM7DSRRLK7/NMGCE7TXWYRSZ7JKOU2SJCHUPXNFUZHL","id":"c3684e89-34ec-4134-943b-c89361b6ee44","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":670,"descending_leading":-210,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":980,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.2","views":8700,"views_recent":604},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":250,"range_left":200,"range_right":700}],"category":"Display","designers":[{"bio":"Manushi

That’s right: this is a display typeface designed for sports jerseys! All the letterforms’ curves have been straightened out into horizontal and vertical lines, held together by some diagonal elements. While most letters from Fiedler have been drawn in a monolinear way, there are a few cases where strokes have been thinned down, to prevent the overall letterform from getting too dark. Have a look at the crossbars on the ‘a’ and ‘e’, for instance. Nippo includes several nice alternates. For instance, one Stylistic Set will replace the standard ‘G’ with a version that has an added beard, but no crossbar. Another includes an ‘L’ whose right-hand side curves up a bit. A third Stylistic Set has alternate forms for ‘M’ and ‘N’, while the fourth includes an alternate ‘R’, the fifth a ‘T’ with curled arms, and the sixth has a closed-topped ‘4’.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/XGP6NMZ4FQQXBWAQUYQLCNIWM3MY32VM/HWS3BEDZGCEJ7OTN77GWTGBZRQI53P5W/DJGEYSEA5LYCU2M3EMH3M7L4NOZIF7NQ","id":"b99fc1cf-e691-45aa-8632-8c115e026c9c","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":530,"y_max":990,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Extralight","name":"Extralight","native_name":null,"number":200,"weight":200}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/UIZQHPRKXWFXXXNCCWAQNPLPYSCZOTGR/L3A56DFAZJEBMFQGUTKRNXGTR6FBT3BU/TC2ABW4Q4UZXRZEJEMO3VSP6VV2XQXQO","id":"0cf58ec5-b3c4-48ce-825a-b112f136b516","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":691,"descending_leading":-201,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":533,"y_max":990,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/U7JSLDUPOD4CH2AU5H6SM6CTOVK6PG6Z/SNDLV7SPHQN4WOXGU7TVOIAJHZT4EK44/VRZUBY2RFQGFI5FK7Z6TUCJRE5WBEFEN","id":"b834e664-5128-4036-a2ab-c4c311eb56c0","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":693,"descending_leading":-203,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":537,"y_max":990,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/CDTACYC4IPPNPYZXG4P4UHS7QK72WJY6/64YLI2LOSKHSMW7BAB55H3OT6QONCPIY/A33XXN3HW5OI7KZNTLP322IHAOQINDEQ","id":"2b8b1020-a149-4e02-b486-342c40c93225","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":696,"descending_leading":-206,"max_char_width":1699,"x_height":543,"y_max":990,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/AFAHDMOVBCROSSGE5GOSMLJMR75FYHZP/MX7VPGBDFGT7ERCST2IAA4LH5KO7BZNK/B3C3BZREKEN22Q6DYVZUXV3W4RJM63VW","id":"ae8e3c2b-f428-4adc-a658-d9b64d5d20bb","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-210,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":550,"y_max":990,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/2OL4LXA5M5I356SBWVB4LAJG3QBQSZFB/FNR7KF5LLYR7Z3432OX45FC55F3P7ZUU/ETCSFVPIPXRJCW4SFAJPOJ7XY2GSEY2C","id":"4352e988-cf2c-4182-b94c-9b8cd2df28d4","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-210,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":550,"y_max":990,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":7178,"views_recent":546},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":850,"range_left":400,"range_right":900}],"category":"Serif","designers":[{"bio":"Jitka

The fonts’ serifs have been designed with chunky, prominent wedge-shaped forms. The letterforms feature a diagonal axis of stress.

Neco’s letterforms have a high amount of stroke contrast, and the degree of contrast really increases from weight to weight. The Black and Black Italic fonts are particularly dynamic, in terms of their appearance. Neco’s lowercase letters have a tall x-height, and their ascenders rise up above the height of the fonts’ capitals. The letterforms in the Italic fonts are not oblique versions of the upright’s glyphs, but true cursive forms. The default numeral style in each font is proportional oldstyle figures, but tabular figures, lining figures, small cap figures, as well as a full range of numerators and denominators for typesetting fractions are in the character set as well. There are also several f-ligatures, substituted into the text by the fonts’ OpenType features. Neco is an excellent choice for use in editorial design, or for typesetting invitations and event-graphics. The fonts were designed by Jitka Janečková.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/SNCBY2VANYQ5HGPPHJ4N2M5CCYL3BWUJ/6D7UWYDMGQRHMCMTIQ5YRTSALARDQ5K7/OM4IMSIGIGZ5VH7YZ3YT2EVE3N2VXU7A","id":"5de2822b-09c7-4950-b1b8-ebd125a47590","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1030,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":498,"y_max":1030,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/ZZRN7VFBUDH3VROXOPGOOPAY3IN4GDT3/LNNK42OHVBMXQX22TH5KP4UJUEY2J756/WW23HEHP6IBKSUFXRT77ZRSCRZTAJQDG","id":"39222cd7-b384-4204-b1db-300345cae923","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1030,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":494,"y_max":1030,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Italic","name":"Italic","native_name":null,"number":401,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/72KH2LTLGR2EXAFQWRRT4UM4OUAHNPWP/WHBFR3YVSAPS3DADHXJNI26ZUBXR2HVN/TZC4JVHXFEFJOTRCIUV4AHKENN4QQ3PA","id":"0d7c691e-76ad-4e32-bbd6-6895f18d6606","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1030,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1706,"x_height":500,"y_max":1030,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/QHVVHWCJ5ZQBEVN6FSQBYIX7VSGITBC5/DOPSWKMOYOUOFLAMAHAKYCEA5PAFOVE3/7B6DU64BQZ3ZQ7JLRRVOIQ6JO3XDZP3F","id":"3d63fb60-4f09-405a-a80b-d9de7243cf66","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1030,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1706,"x_height":499,"y_max":1030,"y_min":-330},"weight":{"label":"Medium

All of the stroke endings in Kola’s glyphs are rounded, and the overall effect of Paris-based type designer Jean-Baptiste Morizot’s stencilling is a bit reminiscent of the kind of lettering used on LED displays. Kola’s lowercase letters have a large x-height, and the ascenders rise up to the same height as the tops of the font’s capital letters and numbers. Despite the x-height being tall, Kola’s diacritical marks are still huge. They tower above the ascenders, capital letters, and numbers, and are very legible and identifiable, even when the font is used in small sizes. In terms of proportion, Kola looks a bit like a contemporary condensed-style sans serif typeface. Many letters in the font have designs that are reduced; the ‘n’ for instance, is almost geometric. The capital ‘I’ and ‘J’ have contrasting designs so that they are easy to tell apart. The dynamic-placement of the stencil-bridges is particularly novel in Kola’s ‘K’, ‘j’, and ‘r’. The tail of Kola’s ‘Q’ is a completely-vertical stroke. Counterforms inside of the letters are large and easy to recognise. Although the lowercase ‘a’ is double-storied, the ‘g’ is single-storey. Because of its stencil treatment, Kola is best used in large sizes. It is an optimal selection for logo design, or for use on concert posters.","styles":[{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/ZVVL6RG6PSMH6O534V2MWEFOHRYXBL6J/XHV4FSH2UVPBH3PWOMYXVOQDVZ5EQXN3/5VPG7YAKNROIGJQ6H545Q24EY5YGPGDT","id":"636ed422-0302-47b0-bf38-441dbdb20e63","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1060,"body_height":null,"cap_height":750,"descending_leading":-185,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":540,"y_max":1060,"y_min":-290},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":3622,"views_recent":208},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":450,"range_left":200,"range_right":700}],"category":"Slab","designers":[{"bio":"Gaetan Baehr's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Gaetan Baehr"}],"name":"Gaetan Baehr"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Logo"},{"name":"Magazines"},{"name":"Poster"},{"name":"Banners"},{"name":"Editorial"},{"name":"Logotype"}],"id":"1fbee521-d727-44d6-8bb2-122b130e6baf","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:35:19Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":false,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Hoover","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

Excon’s letters are top-heavy, a rarely-explored idea in type design Excoffon himself experimented with decades ago. He was followed in this later by a few colleagues in The Netherlands. By referencing Excoffon’s style, Excon’s design drinks from the fountain of French-style sans serifs from the 1950s and 60s. Excon is an excellent choice for corporate identity and editorial design work. The typeface’s letters include some stroke contrast – otherwise their top-heaviness would not be visible – and other typical mid-20th-century traits, like its mixing of a double-storey ‘a’ with a single-storey ‘g’. The stroke contrast is dialled-down in the family’s lightest Thin weight, but by the Black, the contrast is quite pronounced in many characters.

Roundo’s character set is made up of top-heavy letters; this reverse contrast is particularly visible in Roundo’s lowercase letters. The typeface’s lowercase also sports a nice hybridization of geometric sans and humanistic sans design features. Roundo’s capital letters, on the other hand, are more geometric. The x-height of Roundo’s lowercase is tall: this means that the design combines shorter capital letters with ascenders and descenders not long enough to distract the reader. The lowercase “a” takes a double-storey form, while the “g” is single-storey. Roundo’s ascenders are topped off with diagonal shears, adding dynamism to any text set with the typeface. All dots in the typeface – be they for punctuation or other marks – are round. 6 font styles make up the initial Roundo release: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.

Developed for display typography, the family is primarily intended for headline usage. Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system. All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimised for headlines or single word settings.<br><br></div><div>The base character height in the Khand fonts is ‘big on the body.’ Across a line of text, the consonantal forms take up the majority of vertical space. Vowel marks above and below have been shortened – keeping these to a minimum allows for lines of text to be set more closely together vertically. The reduction of interlinear space is paramount for successful headline typesetting, and Khand performs much better in display applications than similar fonts with more elongated vowel marks. Because of their reduced height, the typeface’s vowel mark forms have been simplified somewhat out of necessity, but this stylistic reduction is in-keeping with the modular feeling of the typeface’s overall design. Dot-shaped marks appear rounded in order to help maintain their differentiation from other marks.<br><br></div><div>The Khand family will include five font styles. This broad range of weights makes combinations with a strong degree of contrast possible; the lightest and the heaviest styles may be mixed to create a powerful effect in your design.&nbsp;Khand was designed by Satya Rajpurohit at the Indian Type Foundry and was first published in 2014.<br><br></div><div>Khand is licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

These fonts feature forms that look like those that have been favored by engineers for over a century. Their letters are straight-sided, and the strokes that make them up are monolinear. The Supreme family includes 14 members. Seven of these fonts are italics, although these italic fonts should really be called ‘obliques,’ as the letters are slanted versions of what you’ll find in the upright fonts. The family’s weights range from Extralight through Extrabold. The x-height is moderate, so the ascenders and the descenders are quite prominent. The ascenders rise above the capital letters and the numerals – both of which share the same height. Each font uses a double-storey ‘a’ and single-storey ‘g’. Years ago, fonts like Supreme were primarily used to brand firms in engineering and tech. Recently, however, they have become increasingly popular solutions for setting text on screen. The Regular weight of this family would be excellent for setting body copy either on screen or in print. The other weights can be used for text sizes, too, but will function even better when used large. Supreme was designed by Jeremie Hornus and Ilya Naumoff.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/SXOY54OPHQ5GORKTE5K4LHJ5E4UDSTBU/3W4DXXBZIIUZAF7R7P3XS335E67EFNWF/3TQJM3LST7JIZJBUX4IH5OAMDJS4D5BC","id":"ec68febd-d69f-40f0-acd6-50a6356280c9","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":980,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":476,"y_max":980,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Thin","name":"Thin","native_name":null,"number":100,"weight":100}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/5NSJDTFZTFFJWBVO3OMH2TEW2RLIAGML/F2NRHRDLAA3O2GIYOLCHFOVZ2X5QZHWL/EXWNVVV6F54WHX3JRKLQLMCPFQ2OOET5","id":"1fc2bb45-99e5-48a1-9c9a-4671ac92c4a8","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1000,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":476,"y_max":1000,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Thin

Its letterforms are quite condensed, even for a fixed-width typeface. Because of its narrow width, the capital letters look particularly compressed, offering an interesting look in mixed-case text. RX100’s ascenders are quite tall; they really reach over top of the capitals. The same is true for the font’s diacritical marks: they are very large and will not be overlooked in a text – nor is one diacritical mark likely to be confused for another. This helps ease character recognition, making the typeface a good choice for rendering computer code, or in correspondence that is supposed to look typewritten (a condensed monospace sans serif of this sort automatically calls typewriter faces of the 1970s and 1980s to mind, as those machines were becoming electrified and increasingly sophisticated). RX100’s letterforms features large ink traps to help keep their color in small text even. Interestingly, the font offers 22 alternate uppercase, lowercase, and numeral glyphs, which can be substituted in via OpenType features.

Several of the weights in the family are optimal for setting large amounts of running texts; the extreme light and heavy fonts, on the other hand, work great together in display applications. The letterforms in Clair have a vertical axis, and their design is reminiscent of contemporary newspaper fonts, as well as late-nineteenth century typefaces along the Century model. Zodiak includes 12 styles ranging in weight from Thin to Black. Each of those six weights has a companion italic font, too. Zodiak’s letterforms feature thick slab-like serifs that are bracketed onto their stems. Since the proportions of its uppercase letters are nineteenth-century, they optically feel like they are all almost the same width. The same is true for the numerals, which share the same height as the capitals. The numerals include nice, decorative features, such as flag-like strokes on the bottom of the ‘2’ and the top of the ‘7’. The ascenders of Zodiak’s lowercase letters rise slightly above the tops of the uppercase letters and numerals. Zodiak}s x-height is also rather tall. The lowercase ‘g’ in the upright fonts, which is double-storey, has a lovely ear that ascends above the x-height. In the italic fonts, both the ‘a’ and the ‘g’ are single-storey. The italic letterforms also feature especially-prominent ball terminals. Zodiak is the work of a team of Paris-based type designers including Jeremie Hornus, Gaetan Baehr, Jean-Baptiste Morizot, Alisa Nowak and Theo Guillard.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/TO52MINGLTSYMQYMNWEPPJOYXFXV6GU7/OK23ITC6O5JIDJIVGWRPYNND5ALUMFMO/WFUCMBYRQ2M6KKR2J6JHCB7OU2677MV4","id":"58588385-4ec2-4c2a-9c75-bccbc28aa440","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":490,"y_max":990,"y_min":-250},"weight":{"label":"Thin","name":"Thin","native_name":null,"number":100,"weight":100}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/YHHXSOJF3FMUNYFASBKJQYDXMEIUHENN/X4KG7BQSMV2XYTHYWVAWRAJUH5KZL2UU/PT75L7AUYY6HMWFUPPNRJCD2VYH4CVAF","id":"33e5202d-5375-4895-986a-e344982d9f37","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":990,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":490,"y_max":990,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Thin

True to its name, all of the letterforms in the font are constructed out of segments. This is a perfect choice for use in poster design, as well as for identity work for small businesses inside of cities with good public transit systems. The font would also work well in headlines for articles that touch on digital subjects. Despite the late-twentieth century technology whose style this font is based on, Segment’s design language is actually older and more eclectic. To begin with, for an experimental display font, Segment is most unusual because its letters have serifs. Its old-fashioned style is also particularly apparent in the top-half of the “7”, which approximates a wavy horizontal stroke, as well as on the bottom of the “2” and in the Pound Sterling currency symbol. The capital “R” has a long, sweeping diagonal tail. As you would expect from a classic electronic display font, Segment’s characters are monospaced. All of its glyphs share a common width. The font is also caps-only; the lowercase slots are filled with duplicates of the uppercase letters. None of the base letters like “J” or “Q” have descenders, but the design leaves ample room above and below for the diacritic marks required by various European languages. There are five glyphs in Segment representing the base grids on which either all, or some, of the “segments” in the font have been designed. The character set also contains over a dozen different currency symbols and two OpenType Stylistic Sets, which each offer alternate forms for the font’s range of punctuation marks.","styles":[{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/VZF4NDVQCSRS7EZER7OOWF4WF2ELJH3U/ISIH5XZT5TGQI5UT6U7JDNNKRM6ZQU3X/PUEYM6L6KPQBGIMX4UCVI5GTMQ6PFHBC","id":"bf892678-4cc0-4cd9-873f-3c4a2fad4cab","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1280,"body_height":null,"cap_height":778,"descending_leading":0,"max_char_width":3048,"x_height":778,"y_max":1280,"y_min":-400},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":2513,"views_recent":114},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":900,"range_left":300,"range_right":900}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"Deni Anggara's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Deni Anggara"}],"name":"Deni Anggara"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":"Alternate Q","on_by_default":false,"tag":"ss04"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sinf"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ccmp"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"dlig"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"dnom"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"tnum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"subs"},{"name":"Alternate g","on_by_default":false,"tag":"ss02"},{"name":"Alternate G, a, registered sign","on_by_default":false,"tag":"ss01"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"pnum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"numr"},{"name":"Alternate t","on_by_default":false,"tag":"ss03"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Logos"},{"name":"Magazines"},{"name":"Branding"}],"id":"20e9fcdc-1e41-4559-a43d-1ede0adc8896","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:49:05Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":true,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Satoshi","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

The fonts’ other OpenType features include 10 ligatures per font, as well as alternate versions of the ‘G’ and ’t’. The default numeral style in each of the fonts is proportional lining figures; three other styles of numbers are included, too. There are tabular lining figures, as well as numerators and denominators for typesetting fractions. The fonts’ lining figures have the same height as the uppercase letters. The lowercase’s ascenders are drawn to be slightly taller than the common height of the capital letters and numerals. Each Satoshi font contains ten directional-arrow glyphs, as well as six glyphs of circles, squares, and triangles. There is also a peace sign in the character set, a smiling-face emoji, a check mark, and two versions of the numbers one through nine, each enclosed inside of differently-filled

Their letterforms are drawn with a good degree of contrast between the thick and thick strokes. This contrast gives the whimsical structure seen in some of the characters a more formal nature. There are five weights in the Team family, ranging from Light through Black. Each time you move up the family’s weight scale, the fonts’ thick strokes get thicker, while the thins stay about the same weight. The fonts include a number of ligatures and alternate versions of letterforms, too; these are automatically substituted into text when the OpenType features for Ligatures and Contextual Alternates have been activated. Several of Telma’s uppercase letters have swash-like descenders, such as ‘G’, ‘K’, ‘Q’, and ‘R’. The out-strokes of the lowercase ‘f’, ‘h’, ‘k’, and ‘z’ also descend. Telma has a tall x-height, and the ascenders of the lowercase letters noticeably rise up above than the capitals’ height. The fonts’ numerals are proportionally-spaced oldstyle figures. Developed by the Czech designer Jitka Janečková, Telma is an optimal selection for use in greeting card design and packaging design. Script-fonts like Telma are also often put to good use as headlines in magazines that are printed on glossy paper, as well as in logos designed for small businesses.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/UGIEST3H5PU4CG5IWQF2XDV4BQ4NHM55/MUA7JLTLK6QSMAPQJ4FACPICTYF4RSH5/ROMAJ4X7PNUGL2RNPOEGBQDZXD4WTUYJ","id":"fc941668-ca5a-4d0d-aeb0-f8b09e7eedf9","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":970,"body_height":null,"cap_height":702,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":521,"y_max":970,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/Q4HSPVDYTOUBPOAOZYHPZVC7O2PGIO7Y/SO2ISBDOPZJKRB2HKMZUFXEIBL7Y7II5/5OD6IX4HNMWQSDBVZMNWTXDCHJXE3VSI","id":"4a3bf341-12b0-4dd5-9153-e94b7bd17a8e","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":970,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":531,"y_max":970,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/5ZMY77XGX2TH2CZM4E5UML63QT425DC2/7XE5EXFOMF6YMHIPYY7ZL5M6GZCLRZJL/5P62Q5DLXFO236H3ENSXAF6IHACL2BRG","id":"587b6cda-8416-4417-af91-feafdc6fb83f","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":970,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":536,"y_max":970,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/NKBYZM3FLGWOHDM7WOIMZMHCI5D2TUUS/X3ZSFROUQWHD465VZRJEVARXK2DNN4JW/AI3UKUGMCTKRJM6W6ADNUKZAB4SUTBHO","id":"060aca81-e036-4c3c-b5d9-8af3b739ec73","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":970,"body_height":null,"cap_height":699,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":547,"y_max":970,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/VQ57ZNBQ2K2YXQRCHK4QWNGTWWZYXGAV/4Y7INNLAI24BUKOGEQ6RSJZ2YQKOYCAN/OCZ75D7DJT3RZ3HASTXXIJQUT64HOFCT","id":"61a8c61f-3691-46f8-8731-ce60653350d0","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":970,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":552,"y_max":970,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Black","name":"Black","native_name":null,"number":900,"weight":900}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/GMHGAMYL5VZYA5V7XUTJGL77BHKDBAYQ/NCXVCTCUYCZRYPE4SD3IPCVP53PMS3Q3/6FBVCBUYFJVD6I3VBRVUV4UG7C2LEGQ2","id":"d37d446b-9415-4899-8cf9-a2a537863015","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":970,"body_height":null,"cap_height":680,"descending_leading":-250,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":970,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":13407,"views_recent":854},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":640,"range_left":100,"range_right":700}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"Easha

The diagonals that are typically written with thin strokes in classic serif typefaces maintain thin strokes in Ranade as well, even in the family’s lightest weights. Speaking of weight, Ranade features ten font styles spread across five weights; these range from Thin through Bold. Every weight has both an upright font and an italic on offer. The italic fonts in Ranade are designed in the ‘oblique’ style. The fonts feature a tall x-height. Ascenders rise slightly above the tops of the capital letters, and the the numerals are slightly shorter than the uppercase letters’ height. Lines of text in Ranade can be set tightly and compactly; the uppercase includes no descending elements – both the ‘J’ and ‘Q’ keep all of their strokes between the baseline and the cap-height. Ranade is an excellent selection for use in branding and corporate design. The fonts were developed by Easha Ranade at the Indian Type Foundry in Ahmedabad/India.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/TOJMQKO2ZZ7CXPKDWV5DBVNWKWG5V5NA/LPJG5EU63TWNXXRADQHIRQ2Y5ETOLGCU/4RNSW3A6MNUOPSHX3ZUDPSOVUBV2CNHJ","id":"c9367627-d4e0-4c83-a9a6-f5de876273a5","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1000,"body_height":null,"cap_height":727,"descending_leading":-214,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":521,"y_max":1000,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Thin","name":"Thin","native_name":null,"number":100,"weight":100}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/SGJRG2ZCCOHNIXAXA7IZKCXIMN3A72HC/NFCGXIJBLCD6ZXOL4U3HIS2OYJEMQAYM/EBUW6OCYHS4C4GVDR5S3TN5YCQIENSBJ","id":"2bfc9675-1a9b-414f-91fd-1f82bd537e2b","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1000,"body_height":null,"cap_height":727,"descending_leading":-214,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":521,"y_max":1000,"y_min":-280},"weight":{"label":"Thin

Its three weights have been quite whimsically drawn by type designer Juanjo Lopez. The letterforms are condensed in width, and they all look as if they had been hand-lettered with a fine-tipped pen. This creates a high degree of irregularity in the design. Many of Paquito’s uppercase letters are top-heavy; for example, the upper counter of the ‘R’ is much larger than its lower one. The numerals are neither lining figures nor oldstyle figures; instead, their tops fall somewhere between the x-height and cap-height, and they feature some descending elements, too. The fonts’ lowercase letters have a big x-height, and their ascenders only just peek above the tops of the fonts’ tall capitals. Paquito’s fonts include several useful OpenType features. First and foremost are all of the ligatures – 46 of them, to be exact. There are ligatures for both uppercase and lowercase letter pairs. The fonts also have case-sensitive punctuation, and localized diacritics for Polish (this feature substitutes true kreskas in place of acute accents). Paquito should be used in larger point sizes, where its details and intentional quirks will be visible. Another characteristic that makes Paquito good for headlines and display applications is the relative narrowness with which it has been drawn; at sizes like those that these fonts should be used, such a space-saving quality is quite helpful. In terms of areas of design, Paquito will be useful in editorial work, but it may shine even more in design for the gastronomic sector (both in restaurant identities & menu-typesetting, as well as in design for food packaging).","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/ULZX7LFRNCEJDIMKUV3VTF2LKTQ4S6OO/2BKALQCTQNYPJA2Y53FVESTXK4DFE6QY/TZLLU3XJTXLOU3EH4DRXDJ32LMCC7HBG","id":"b5547ff3-46d6-49d4-9998-073106fb7591","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1080,"body_height":null,"cap_height":715,"descending_leading":-213,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":502,"y_max":1080,"y_min":-380},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/6QKRR4SJPXSUUQBXWVHYFZSG6ZE2Z32Z/FP4AZ4PCCJWNZ5SQYV3ZALJXE4VNEKBV/O7JBWBMMHOX2OCMEIDXBLVBKTUPVPFVX","id":"b81ba2f0-0cc8-42dd-aabb-b633ff66eeb4","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1080,"body_height":null,"cap_height":715,"descending_leading":-213,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":503,"y_max":1080,"y_min":-380},"weight":{"label":"Medium","name":"Medium","native_name":null,"number":500,"weight":500}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/LNWLDBHBQVEFRZ2QGYDRFF5PRRVQCTXF/SCSGJSL6F77ZROM6FFKUNGUSVCG3IZUV/ZXFNBFTLCWG55RNEYWOYFOHF4ZQ25IRK","id":"8aaaaf59-68a6-4d05-b86d-391a268c16c5","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1080,"body_height":null,"cap_height":715,"descending_leading":-213,"max_char_width":1828,"x_height":504,"y_max":1080,"y_min":-380},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/2NB7NET6D5XC3BZAFYG25WR77UFVXF5Y/P2URT4J3YJ7FLI6GYCBCWZCW4T4WNNPB/IXTMTFCRATT33QJPW6LKBQTKQTNA4FP3","id":"ccc1dbd8-ef1d-45d0-9e35-4f95af7a3320","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1080,"body_height":null,"cap_height":705,"descending_leading":-213,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":482,"y_max":1080,"y_min":-380},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":3448,"views_recent":178},{"axes":[{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":600,"range_left":300,"range_right":900},{"name":"wght","property":"wght","range_default":360,"range_left":300,"range_right":900}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"Inga Plönnigs's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Inga Plönnigs"}],"name":"Inga Plönnigs"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":true,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"lnum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ccmp"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"onum"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Poster"},{"name":"Books"},{"name":"Magazines"},{"name":"Newspapers"}],"id":"3f70c7e4-4631-4e90-90ba-0fcd0fed8547","inserted_at":"2021-03-12T20:40:07Z","is_hot":false,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":false,"languages":"Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Aranese, Aromanian, Aymara, Azeri (Latin), Basque, Bemba, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Cheyenne, Chichewa, Chuukese, Cofán, Cornish, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Finnish, French, Frisian, Friulian, Ga, Galician, Ganda, German, Gikuyu, Greenlandic, Guaraní, Guarani, Gwich’in, Haitian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Igbo, Indonesian, Interlingua, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Javanese, Karelian, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kiribati, Kirundi, Kituba, Kurdish (Latin), Ladin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxemburgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maninka, Manx, Māori, Marshallese, Náhuatl, Nauruan, Navajo, Ndebele (Northern), Ndebele (Southern), Norfuk, Norn, Norwegian (Bokmål), Norwegian (Nynorsk), Nyanja, Occitan, Oromo, Otomi, Palauan, Papiamento, Pedi, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Rarotongan, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romaji, Romani, Romanian, Sámi (Inari), Sámi (Lule), Sámi (Northern), Sámi (Southern), Samoan, Sango, Sardinian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian (Latin), Seychelles Creole, Shona, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Somali (Latin), Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swati, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tahitian, Tetum, Tok Pisin, Tokelauan, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Turkish, Tuvalu, Twi, Ulithian, Umbundu, Veps, Vietnamese, Welsh, Wolof, Xhosa, Zulu","license_type":"itf_ffl","name":"Plein","native_name":null,"publisher":{"bio":"Indian Type Foundry (ITF) creates retail and custom multilingual fonts for print and digital media.

The typeface’s clear and open forms are very legible and pleasant to read, too. The fonts’ letters are drawn with virtually monolinear strokes. The family has ten font styles available; there are five weights, ranging from Light to Black, and each weight has an upright and and italic font on offer. In Plein’s upright fonts, the lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ have double-storey forms; in the italics, these are single-storey. The stem of the ‘f’ in Plein’s italics descends below the baseline. The default numerals in the fonts are proportional oldstyle figures. Lining figures are also available, via an OpenType feature. The fonts also include case-sensitive punctuation, which can be substituted into all-caps text. Humanist sans serif typefaces are used in a wide variety of design projects today. Therefore, Plein is an excellent choice for work in branding and corporate design, but you could also use it to set texts of medium length in editorial design work. It might even be worth trying it out on signage and in navigation design projects. Plein comes from Inga Plönnigs, an independent type designer in Berlin and a graduate of the Type & Media program at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Hague.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/I7B77Y5EXENYKOPCCIHY6G3IMY2GWKPE/AJBNJP4E4YX3GPYJQP34CKS7V24H63LX/PTDEYSNMFHSKPTJYUDB5NT6GPYNVMFOL","id":"2356b8ac-db2c-4e9e-843e-6ff2b29bd229","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1030,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-240,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":1030,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/U6DQ5PLFJ3JBPYDO6NPSJS5S6QGBUAPK/KJSF2USAMFIOAN3UAIVD35KHRICF4YJU/7R52BJDTIMAMMYKX23D2Y4VLSP7SOPF4","id":"f9d0a7f4-2d67-4fb4-ae28-6e6900a49ee3","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":1030,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-240,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":500,"y_max":1030,"y_min":-270},"weight":{"label":"Light

As a family of fonts, it is particularly large; its 16 styles include a range of eight weights: ExtraLight, Light, SemiLight, Regular, SemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold, and Black. Each weight has a companion italic font, which is oblique in style. On Fontstore, you’ll find a matching font family for this design: Pramukh (a non-rounded version of this design). Both Pramukh and Pramukh Rounded are designed by Aarya Purohit and ITF. While Pramukh and Pramukh Rounded each make use of modernist typographic vocabulary, Pramukh Rounded is the more open and friendly adaptation of the theme. It offers an excellent toolkit for use in corporate identity, editorial, and even poster design – wherever a narrow sans serif is needed, but where a degree of warmth should brighten up the formal nature of the typography, too. The styles in the Pramukh Rounded family become less compressed with each step up the weight scale; however, the heaviest Black weight’s letters still have visibly-condensed proportions. The fonts’ lowercase letters have been designed with a tall x-height; their ascenders only rise slightly above the height of the capitals. OpenType features unlock alternate forms for the letters ‘A’, ‘G’, ‘K’, ‘R’, ‘V’, ‘W’, and ‘Y’. These alternates can be used to break up the strict-modernist feeling of the typeface, and make it look more constructed or industrial (the alternate ‘g’, on the other hand, offers an even more high-modernist shape than the standard ‘g’ form). The fonts also include TT and Ti ligatures, as well as the expected f-ligatures.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/4BTG7OS7O7OYLLVTHTACSUXHBHMMHZL3/7USWUINE7X4Y5J5T53RK33WROY5SNLNX/UEYYU3YFF2DD7PETXHWPZZKRBGX4DRAT","id":"443c8834-6a68-4e4b-a810-f5254fc860e8","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":940,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-100,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":562,"y_max":940,"y_min":-230},"weight":{"label":"Extralight","name":"Extralight","native_name":null,"number":200,"weight":200}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/O7LPK2QSQ6BMN3BUF76D3ENHEHH4EZHN/62Q7LMGQSLLQHRU2CPU65CSX2LAH3DGU/MSPTY4RTWE5OGGJLOEEZAALTF5MVFCIE","id":"70d674db-38c2-4dfd-8b26-926fbaf396cd","is_italic":true,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":940,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-100,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":562,"y_max":940,"y_min":-230},"weight":{"label":"Extralight

Recia is a contemporary-style serif. The family comes in 10 styles, and its five Italic fonts are ‘true-italic’ designs, which feature a cursive-structure in the letters. Its x-height is pretty high and the characters are slightly condensed, with strokes that are rather low-contrast. In the lighter weights, hardly any stroke contrast is visible between the thick and thin portions of the letters, but in the Bold weights, stroke contrast is clear, but the thinner strokes are still quite chunky. The serifs all take wedge-shapes. Each font contains 516 glyphs, and the character set offers users multiple figure styles via OpenType features. The default numeral versions are proportional oldstyle figures.

There are eight weights available, ranging in color from Thin through Black. All of the typeface’s weights are virtually monospaced, and with each weight of the family, the outside ‘strokes’ building up the letterforms increase in thickness. Styro’s characters are very condensed, and their design employs a reductionist formal vocabulary. For example, the counterforms are expressed by thin lines that run inside of the letters, from their tops to their bottoms. These ‘counters’ are optically of the same width as the spaces between each letter. Many of the fonts’ stroke terminals – like those on the top of the ‘a’ or on the bottom of the ‘g’ – are reduced to simple geometric shapes. Diactical marks take the form of light thin lines, which create a nice degree of contrast with their base letters. This thin-line treatment is also applied to many of the fonts’ punctuation marks. Styro is reminiscent of a series of stencil letters designed at the Bauhaus by Josef Albers, although Styro includes separate shapes for both uppercase and lowercase letters, instead of being a unicameral design. The Styro fonts were developed by Aarya Purohit at Indian Type Foundry, and they are an excellent choice for use in editorial design pieces about modern art and

It includes five different styles, ranging in weight from Light to Black. The typeface, named after a kind of marker, looks very sign-painterly – almost as if its letters had been written out quickly with a flat brush. All of its letterforms are slanted, and they do not connect with the characters that come before or after them. Sharpie’s strokes are very angular in their appearance. The stroke-contrast is rather modest in the Light weight, but by the Black, it is very strong (really quite awesomely so). Sharpie’s lowercase letters don’t have a very tall x-height. The tops of the ascending-lowercase letters, the capitals, and the numerals all rise to about the same point. The ‘a’ and the ‘g’ in Sharpie are both single-storey in their forms. The typeface is designed by Théo Guillard.","styles":[{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/WCIIQDUFTCQBZFDHWRCSTKF52R5EXUWT/DHMS7OWQFOB6Q24B73SZZQWJ2X54KYKA/BHQLPLXFHMPUUPFT27XLHKYLE2C3XRMR","id":"0a598125-1c1b-4e90-b896-8741ad45f2ed","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":920,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-194,"max_char_width":1739,"x_height":482,"y_max":920,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Light","name":"Light","native_name":null,"number":300,"weight":300}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/LCVGQ32RKOGWKQCVQA4FSUCLBTK7B4OO/SRMMO5FG7SLD73FT36IHBHOVAWDIUB4T/FZPYHU7WM7VKJ2XCLFZEY4VBQYEXEWMU","id":"2322ed8c-c7a6-4cfb-b3d5-5b3ff3f1f67e","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":920,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-196,"max_char_width":1718,"x_height":489,"y_max":920,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Regular","name":"Regular","native_name":null,"number":400,"weight":400}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/PIAXUBBFI5TB5V7M6HLDUAHSATPQWSW4/XQHPNLNTXL624THLGR3NLZN3VZPPG2ZS/XKISSNYMTTK6MXKC6X5YIAZNIHJUMZ2M","id":"b03bb648-de93-4094-adec-a791cefed894","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":920,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-198,"max_char_width":1695,"x_height":496,"y_max":920,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Bold","name":"Bold","native_name":null,"number":700,"weight":700}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/IFWAK3WGDQZO2WVPJVQLWUZ6KJREGMUB/C7QS2YTCQECB452MHIFYXZ65LWC3BZCP/7CO3YAPKDEMYTOSYRAOHWT6N56MTIMHK","id":"27a21047-2af8-4ac0-9aaa-bc18d1a0fed8","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":920,"body_height":null,"cap_height":700,"descending_leading":-200,"max_char_width":1669,"x_height":505,"y_max":920,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Extrabold         ","name":"Extrabold","native_name":null,"number":800,"weight":800}},{"default":false,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/7UVGHISZQ7F3NBM4WKMDRY3EA7MDETFN/YC5CTKTCKM4NDIHN2ED6GDNJLIY5U755/2Y2YCNXC6ALMHDCOQKGOYKNCKBPXWGVC","id":"42b2e77a-d835-44e1-b1d4-6c2a613f7812","is_italic":false,"is_variable":false,"properties":{"ascending_leading":920,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-202,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":511,"y_max":920,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Black","name":"Black","native_name":null,"number":900,"weight":900}},{"default":true,"file":"//cdn.fontshare.com/wf/P6UA4HJUDOABDHUVU4NEOSH66DCYD5ZV/SXHQ672ZCYGN3IYDZDSEU7QBPGM7STYE/WEN5JW4WV76O2NRXV3U6GFNFPXXGCTIR","id":"ff60a298-99a0-42ce-ba9a-33815b2c2d12","is_italic":false,"is_variable":true,"properties":{"ascending_leading":920,"body_height":null,"cap_height":690,"descending_leading":-202,"max_char_width":1639,"x_height":494,"y_max":920,"y_min":-310},"weight":{"label":"Variable","name":"Variable","native_name":null,"number":1,"weight":0}}],"trials_enabled":true,"version":"1.0","views":6837,"views_recent":378},{"axes":[{"name":"Weight","property":"wght","range_default":540,"range_left":300,"range_right":900}],"category":"Sans","designers":[{"bio":"MCKL's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/MCKL"}],"name":"MCKL"},{"bio":"Jeremy Mickel's bio Bio","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Jeremy Mickel"}],"name":"Jeremy Mickel"}],"display_publisher_as_designer":false,"features":[{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"subs"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ss02"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"frac"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"pnum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"salt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sinf"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"aalt"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"numr"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ss01"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"case"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"dnom"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"ordn"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"liga"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"locl"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"tnum"},{"name":null,"on_by_default":false,"tag":"sups"}],"font_tags":[{"name":"Magazines"},{"name":"Banners"},{"name":"Corporate"},{"name":"Websites"}],"id":"6d442fdc-c73b-4f4c-aad7-3f261b645d59","inserted_at":"2022-05-23T12:37:57Z","is_hot":true,"is_new":false,"is_shortlisted":null,"is_top":false,"languages":"","license_type":"sil_ofl","name":"Red Hat Display","native_name":null,"publisher":null,"related_families":null,"script":"latin","show_latin_metrics":true,"slug":"red-hat-display","story":"<div>The Red Hat typeface is a superfamily of Display, Text, and Mono styles, each with a range of weights in roman and italic.

The Display styles, made for headlines and big statements, are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters.

SORA, meaning sky in Japanese, is focused on empowering projects that benefit society by delivering new goods and services.<br><br></div><div>The SORA typeface was designed to capture SORAMITSU's spirit and heritage and is highly optimised for user interfaces. The outcome is a type family with cues of low-resolution aesthetics and early screen typography but without nostalgia, as every decision was considered towards the crisp digital environment of today. The particularly big x-height combined with evidently generous counters turns the family into a convenient tool for app and web interfaces, where clarity and effectiveness at any size is an imperative.
